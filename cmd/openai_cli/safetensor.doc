Format
8 bytes: N, an unsigned little-endian 64-bit integer, containing the size of the header
N bytes: a JSON UTF-8 string representing the header.
The header data MUST begin with a { character (0x7B).
The header data MAY be trailing padded with whitespace (0x20).
The header is a dict like {"TENSOR_NAME": {"dtype": "F16", "shape": [1, 16, 256], "data_offsets": [BEGIN, END]}, "NEXT_TENSOR_NAME": {...}, ...},
data_offsets point to the tensor data relative to the beginning of the byte buffer (i.e. not an absolute position in the file), with BEGIN as the starting offset and END as the one-past offset (so total tensor byte size = END - BEGIN).
A special key __metadata__ is allowed to contain free form string-to-string map. Arbitrary JSON is not allowed, all values must be strings.
Rest of the file: byte-buffer.
